The texture is aided by tingling carbonation and mild juicy fruity notes w/ light sweet and nutty/woody earthy tinges and mild acidity w/ a semi-sweet finish.
The astringent aspect is mild w/ alcohol only noted in very slight ways
The finish is semi-dry w/ a refreshing flavor -more than any other single hop ale I have had.

Creamy and a bit oily from the focus of malt richness and wheat, the beer carries a consistent texture from early creaminess through late fullness until the strength of alchol breaks apart the beer and allows for an alcoholic semi-dry finish.
A hint of oily feel comes out of the toffee-buttery note and may offer the slightest of distractions.
But the oily malt character offers just a slight flaw in taste and texture.

Fruity, cascade-packed, then sort of thin and floating away in the mouthfeel but addicting, this beer is a museum of the first wave of IPA's.

Into the mouth, it begins with a dripping caramel and black liquorice hues.

Thin mouthfeel.
The chewy malt adds a little texture to the brew.
Medium body, which is quite nice.
Smooth and extra soft on the palate--possibly a tad buttery.
Well carbonated, this is a sturdy, very drinkable beer that has joined me for much leisure time.
On the palate, the beer has a nice mouthfeel, definite hope bitterness, long finish with a slight hop astringency.
The body is on the lighter side and very smooth, allowing this brew to live up to its name.
Slick moutfeel.
Marzen's tend to be a bit thin in the mouthfeel for me but even this didn't match up to my less-than-lofty expectations.
This is not the kind of beer I would want to get drunk on and even though the carbonation didn't detract from the taste, this wasn't something that I could down very quickly.
M: light body and carbonation, very sharp and crisp with a bone dry finish.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spritzy up front, and smooth in the finish.
Fairly light bodied.
High carbonation.
M - Fairly light and thin but also quite smooth.
M: This beer has the feel of a good spring beer.
It is light and thin on the tongue with the presence of prickly carbonation.
It has a nice, full mouth feel with small, soft bubbles.
The flavor is moderately sweet with lingering alcohol and prunes.
Medium-light body with decent carbonation.
Very smooth drink with a bite during the finish, a certain spice that I couldn't place but was very direct and I just burped another taste of it (two hours later).
Mouthfeel - way too bubbly, interferes with the flavor, inhibiting the sweetness.
I like the smoothness, though, and it has a good body on it.
M - full bodied and smooth.
Nice mouthfeel.
a tinge from the abv felt at the finish.
M - Thin, but expected for style.
M/D: Medium bodied.
M: Medium body, crisp, with medium to high carbonation
Full bodied with an alcoholic texture and a soft carbonation.
Smooth and very nice thick beer.
M - Light and refreshing.
Not too carbonated nor heavy.
Mouth feel- This one borders on a light and medium body.
It certainly is not the creamiest IPA out there by any stretch of the imagination
M - It was soft on the tongue and medium-bodied.
Mouthfeel: Very smooth and full-bodied with a nice carbonation bite.
Mouthfeel- Good carbonation level.
Nice chewey, medium bodied beer.
Mouthfeel is chewy, bitter, sweet, and semi-dry.
mouthfeel is alright, a bit overcarbonated for my liking, but it does well to reinforce the wine/champagne aspects of this beer.
M: Medium body, not too thick, but pretty smooth and almost creamy.
No sign of alcohol in this beer.
There's a bit of a tart mouthfeel.
The mouth is pretty solid, a bit light but not all that unexpected with a coffee blend.
Its fairly smooth, not quite creamy, well carbonated, thoroughly, exceptionally drinkable.
The body was smooth and creamy, but this spice bomb was a drain pour for me.
M - Slightly about average body with a perfect amount of carbonation.
M- Medium body, pretty high carbonation, pretty clean
M: Given the light color, this one's heavier in heft than anticipated - call it medium in weight (also another area of difference with Sculpin, which I keep coming back to due to that apricot taste and light coloring).
Slight slickness to the feel.
Mouthfeel: Good carbonation - cleanses the palate but doesn't scour it.
Just a bit thick, but smooth
relatively light body, but a lively feeling carbonation.
It was watery with moderate carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste.
Very light watery mouthfeel, but not very crisp.
Dense, oily feel foamy on the tongue.
Good body and carbonation.
Finish is good.
Mouthfeel is full bodied, sweet, yeasty, slightly chewy with a lovely finish that makes you crave more.
Taste/Mouthfeel: Feels creamy in the mouth.
Spotted Cow feels very light and thin, which here isn't bad....
Medium bodied.
Feels light and crisp in the mouth.
Medium-low body.
Body was kind of heavy, but not thick.
